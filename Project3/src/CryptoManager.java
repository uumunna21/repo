 * simple “substitution cipher” where characters in a message are replaced by a
 * substitute character. The second approach, due to Giovan Battista Bellaso,
 * uses a key word, where each character in the word specifies the offset for
 * the corresponding character in the message, with the key word wrapping around
 * as needed.
